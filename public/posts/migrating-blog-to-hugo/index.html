<h1 id="circle-of-blog-life">CIRCLE OF (BLOG) LIFE</h1>

<p>When I first began this journey several years back, including writing about my
journey, I first used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.  I barely knew what git
was let alone Github Pages.  However, I pushed through and brought to life the
original &lsquo;Old Guy New Trick&rsquo; blog.</p>

<p>After a couple of years, I decided to port my Jekyll based blog to my very own
home grown Rails app - <a href="https://github.com/hogihung/flex_blogger">FlexBlogr</a>. This
platform served me well for a few years.  FlexBlogr provided me an opportunity
to create my very own Open-Source project as well as provide me a neat blogging
platform - one where I could create blog posts via the web browser vs. creating
markdown files, committing to git, and publishing.</p>

<p>Around September of 2018 I decided that, although I did my best to pitch using
Elixir and Phoenix for our next-gen version of our API, I was not able to make any
traction.  I believe Ruby will always be my true love as far as programming languages
go, and I really liked how Elixir and Phoenix made this Rubyist feel at home.</p>

<p>However, sometimes we need to work within our environment, and it was clear that
Golang was making traction.  We already had a new app written and supported by
just one team member.  As much as I wanted to continue with learning and working
with Elixir, I had to switch my focus to Go.</p>

<p>So at the end of 2018 I wrote my first Go app - <a href="https://github.com/hogihung/jblastor">JBlastor</a>.
It if far from perfect, <strong>cough no tests cough</strong> but it was helpful in getting me
started with Go.  During my research of <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> I stumbled upon
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.  Hugo brought back fond memories of my early days with
Ruby so I thought it appropriate for me to migrate my Blog to Hugo - a fresh start
of a new segement of my journey.</p>

<p>In addition to migrating to Hugo, I also want to re-visit an old friend - Heroku.
When I first started learning Ruby, and getting my app visible to the the &lsquo;net&rsquo;,
I used Heroku.  I know since those early days Heroku has improved by leaps and bounds
and I think it appropriate that my &lsquo;reboot&rsquo; bring me back to my roots.  So this blog
will be hosted on Heroku.</p>

<p>Please be patient with me as I migrate all my old posts from FlexBlogr, which is
stored in a Postgres database, over to Hugo.  In addition to this migration, I
also want to get back into the habbit of publishing new posts each month.  I am
embarrased to admit that is has been over two years since I published a new article
to FlexBlogr.  I have published to Medium, and going forward will probably cross
post between here and Medium.</p>

<p>If you are new to &lsquo;Old Guy New Trick (OGNT)&rsquo; then welcome!  For those that have
been with me for a while, please accept my apologies from being absent.  Although
I have been sharing my stories at MeetUps, I&rsquo;ve been negligent with sharing/teaching
via my blog posts.</p>
