# IP Man, err I mean Binary Ipsum

As an intravert, it is hard for me to do public speaking.  But after enjoying so many speakers at Conferences and our local RubyJax MeetUp, I decided that I had to buck up and do a presentation.  This past October I pushed my nervousness down to my feet and presented my crafted BinaryIpsum talk for RubyJax.

I have made the code repo, Tutorial and all related material available on Github at this [link](https://github.com/hogihung/binary_ipsum).

As the README.md file suggests, start with the Tutorial.md file.  At the end of that file you will find links that emulate a live coding session from start to finish.  There are also links for the presentation in both Keynote and PDF formats.

By the way, the movies [IP Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_Man_(film_series)) and IP Man 2 are awesome!  They were, when I watched them, streaming on Netflix.


HoGi...
