# CIRCLE OF (BLOG) LIFE 

When I first began this journey several years back, including writing about my 
journey, I first used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  I barely knew what git 
was let alone Github Pages.  However, I pushed through and brought to life the
original 'Old Guy New Trick' blog.

After a couple of years, I decided to port my Jekyll based blog to my very own
home grown Rails app - [FlexBlogr](https://github.com/hogihung/flex_blogger). This
platform served me well for a few years.  FlexBlogr provided me an opportunity 
to create my very own Open-Source project as well as provide me a neat blogging 
platform - one where I could create blog posts via the web browser vs. creating 
markdown files, committing to git, and publishing.

Around September of 2018 I decided that, although I did my best to pitch using
Elixir and Phoenix for our next-gen version of our API, I was not able to make any
traction.  I believe Ruby will always be my true love as far as programming languages
go, and I really liked how Elixir and Phoenix made this Rubyist feel at home.  

However, sometimes we need to work within our environment, and it was clear that 
Golang was making traction.  We already had a new app written and supported by
just one team member.  As much as I wanted to continue with learning and working
with Elixir, I had to switch my focus to Go.  

So at the end of 2018 I wrote my first Go app - [JBlastor](https://github.com/hogihung/jblastor).
It if far from perfect, **cough no tests cough** but it was helpful in getting me
started with Go.  During my research of [Go](https://golang.org/) I stumbled upon
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  Hugo brought back fond memories of my early days with
Ruby so I thought it appropriate for me to migrate my Blog to Hugo - a fresh start
of a new segement of my journey.

In addition to migrating to Hugo, I also want to re-visit an old friend - Heroku.
When I first started learning Ruby, and getting my app visible to the the 'net',
I used Heroku.  I know since those early days Heroku has improved by leaps and bounds
and I think it appropriate that my 'reboot' bring me back to my roots.  So this blog
will be hosted on Heroku.

Please be patient with me as I migrate all my old posts from FlexBlogr, which is 
stored in a Postgres database, over to Hugo.  In addition to this migration, I
also want to get back into the habbit of publishing new posts each month.  I am
embarrased to admit that is has been over two years since I published a new article
to FlexBlogr.  I have published to Medium, and going forward will probably cross
post between here and Medium.

If you are new to 'Old Guy New Trick (OGNT)' then welcome!  For those that have
been with me for a while, please accept my apologies from being absent.  Although
I have been sharing my stories at MeetUps, I've been negligent with sharing/teaching
via my blog posts.
